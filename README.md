# social-coding
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hezaaron/social-coding.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hezaaron/social-coding)

The ***social-coding*** **App** encourages users to train their programming skills. I've deployed it on
Heroku: https://iplusplus-client.herokuapp.com. **To** **_login_**, use the credentials below:

> username: hezaaron+01@gmail.com
> password: h326Otaa

Running it locally now may not yield the expected result as I'm working on the second version which include
some gamification techniques, a mobile client and social login (e.g login with your google account).
So there is a lot of changes and some refactoring going on. When it's finished, I will provide the steps to
run it locally.
